# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) working in this repository.

Be direct and objective. Offer solutions alongside criticism rather than agreement by default.

This is a [Laioutr](https://laioutr.com) App — a Nuxt module extending a Laioutr storefront. The
README covers setup, the playground and publishing; this file does not repeat it. Keep both current
as the app grows, and delete the parts of this file that stop applying.

## Working here

**Run `pnpm dev:prepare` before lint or typecheck.** `tsconfig.json` extends `./.nuxt/tsconfig.json`,
which that command generates. Without it the import resolver cannot read any path and lint reports
every import as unresolved — hundreds of errors that are pure artifact.

```bash
pnpm test:types                            # vue-tsc over the module and the playground
pnpm vitest run src/path/to/file.test.ts   # a single suite
```

## Architecture

`src/module.ts` is the Nuxt module entry: it registers runtime config, server routes, public assets
and page types, and hands the Orchestr directory to `registerLaioutrApp`.

**Orchestr handler types**, by filename suffix under `src/runtime/server/orchestr/<entity>/`:

- `*.query.ts` — fetch and return entity IDs
- `*.link.ts` — relationships between entities
- `*.resolver.ts` — resolve data components for an entity
- `*.action.ts` — mutations and side effects
- `*.page-index.ts` — enumerate a page type's entities and resolve a URL back to one
- `*.template.ts` — preset, labelled query inputs an editor picks from in Studio

Canonical entity types come from `@laioutr-core/canonical-types`. Apps consume them and do not define
them — a shape that feels wrong belongs upstream, not patched locally.

## Rules

### Paths the app owns

Every URL an app owns is namespaced under `/app-<name>/`, where `<name>` is the app segment of the
package name — public assets (`src/runtime/app/public/app-<name>/…`), server routes, and any page it
registers. An app shares one origin with the project's editor-created content pages and every other
installed app, so an un-namespaced path collides.

Two hard don'ts:

1. **Never route a browser navigation through `/api/laioutr/*`.** frontend-core gates that namespace
   behind the project secret; a link click or redirect sends no such header and gets a 401. Reserve
   it for authenticated JSON endpoints the app's own code calls with the secret.
2. **Never use a bare top-level path** (`/checkout`, `/cart`) — it collides with content slugs.

### Nitro and Nuxt hooks

Name hooks `namespace:entity:action` in kebab-case, present tense before an action and past tense
after. A hook earns its place where code runs an effect the developer cannot otherwise reach.

For hooks whose handlers influence a returned value, pass a `result: { value }` slot — hookable
ignores handler return values, so mutation is the only way out — and read it back synchronously. A
**bail** hook (no seed, runs before the default) selects or replaces; a **filter** hook (seeded with
the resolved default, runs after) post-processes. Seed the same slot you read.

Do not put a filter hook inside a composable that merely computes and returns a value — the caller
already owns that value. Put it where the value is applied on the app's behalf.

### Money

Money is `{ amount, currency }` where `amount` is **minor units (cents)** and `currency` is an
**ISO 4217 code** (`EUR`, `USD`) — never a symbol, never a label, never lowercase. Default to `EUR`
in fixtures unless the currency is material.

```ts
{ amount: 1999, currency: 'EUR' }   // ✅
{ amount: 19.99, currency: 'EUR' }  // ✘ must be cents
{ amount: 1999, currency: '€' }     // ✘ symbol
```

### Comments

Comments explain **why**. The code already says what. The failure mode here is over-commenting.

- Say the reason, constraint or consequence — not a paraphrase of the line below.
- Present tense, describing the code as it is. Git holds the changelog; a comment is not one.
- Comment the code that is there, not code that isn't. Never explain a removed line or warn against
  a tempting alternative — that addresses a hypothetical editor while every real reader pays for it.
  The pull is strongest right after fixing a bug; resist it. That rationale belongs in the commit
  message and the changeset.
- One line where one line does. No banners, no ASCII art, no JSDoc restating a signature.

A live constraint the code obeys is fair game (`upstream returns null despite the type`).

### No design-doc references

Never cite a design doc, plan, spec, ADR or review from code, comments, test names or error
messages — no `§4.1`, no doc paths, no plan-invented IDs. Section numbers drift, and the reader
wanted the reason, not a filing reference. State it inline in a clause instead.

Real external identifiers are fine: ticket keys, RFC numbers, published spec sections, CVEs,
upstream issue URLs.

### Sections and blocks

Do not write Vue component tests — no mounting, no Vue Test Utils, no component snapshots — unless
explicitly asked. Tests for composables, helpers and pure logic are wanted.

Prefer plain `defineConfig` in `vitest.config.ts` for pure-function suites. `@nuxt/test-utils`'
`defineVitestConfig` boots a Nuxt instance and pulls in happy-dom to build a DOM those suites never
touch, and it regenerates the root `.nuxt` without the playground's config. Reserve it for tests that
genuinely need the Nuxt environment, like the e2e fixture in `test/`.

`defineSection`'s `studio.description` carries the load for both humans and agents. The optional `ai`
metadata takes only `description` and `examples`, and **an absent `ai` object is the normal state**.
When present it states declarative, non-inferable facts — never use/avoid/never guidance, which
measurably degrades composition, and never anything already visible in the schema.

### Changesets

Write for the **package consumer**, not the contributor. Build internals, refactor lists and
type-system mechanics belong in the commit message. A purely internal change needs no changeset.

Breaking changes flag themselves in the body with a bold `**Breaking:**` prefix and a before/after
snippet. Every file in `.changeset/` is unreleased and ships as one changelog section, so a changeset
describes the feature at release, not the increment one PR added — rewrite an existing entry rather
than adding a sibling that only parses if you read the first.

### TypeScript refactoring

**Use LSP `findReferences`, not grep, to find symbol references** — before deleting a symbol, file or
export, or when planning a rename. Grep misses template usages, dynamic references and type-only
imports. Fall back to grep only when the LSP returns nothing (Nuxt `#imports` auto-imports are the
usual case).

For bulk transforms prefer, in order: a TypeScript LSP tool, then ast-grep, then ts-morph. Remove any
temporary refactor script when you are done.

### Bulk refactors

- **Preserve every comment.** JSDoc, TODOs and inline notes get silently stripped during bulk
  rewrites. Carry them over.
- Audit afterwards in this order: exported names → helper types → properties → runtime functions →
  comments. "Typecheck passes" is not sufficient.

### Git safety

Do not use `git reset`, `git checkout HEAD`, `git stash` or any other command that can discard tree
changes without asking first. If the tree is in an unexpected state, offer the user the chance to fix
it themselves.

Never suppress output on state-changing git commands — the exit code does not distinguish "applied
cleanly" from "left a half-merged tree". Before claiming work is committed, run `git diff HEAD --stat`
and confirm the files you expect are listed.

### Subagents

When spawning subagents, pass `model` explicitly and use only `opus` or `sonnet` — never `fable` or
`haiku`. Rule of thumb: `sonnet` for research and mechanical work, `opus` for complex implementation
or judgment-heavy review.

## Conventions

**Commits** follow conventional commits, Angular style — `feat(scope): …`, `fix: …`, `chore: …`.

**Namespaces**: `@laioutr/*` is public npm; `@laioutr-core/*`, `@laioutr-app/*` and
`@laioutr-org/<org>__<app>` live on npm.laioutr.cloud. Platform packages belong in
`peerDependencies` so the host project supplies one copy.

**Design docs and plans**, if you write them, go in `docs/plans/` as
`YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` or `-plan.md`. Research goes in `docs/research/`, reviews in
`docs/reviews/` — not in `docs/plans/`.

New rules given by the user go in `.claude/rules/` as their own file. Ask if a rule is unclear.
